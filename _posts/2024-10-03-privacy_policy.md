# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: October 03, 2024_

This Privacy Policy explains how **Quincy** (the “Bot”) collects, uses, and discloses information when you use the Bot on Discord. By using Quincy, you agree to the collection and use of information as outlined in this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

When using **Quincy**, certain data may be collected automatically to enable the Bot's functionality and to improve your experience. The types of data collected include:

- **User Data**: We may collect your Discord User ID, username, and relevant interactions with the Bot.
- **Server Data**: Server IDs, roles, and configurations where the Bot is used may be collected for server-specific features.
- **Message Data**: The content of messages may be processed when you interact with commands (e.g., moderation actions, requests for information). Only messages relevant to the Bot's functionality are processed, and they are not stored beyond their necessary use unless explicitly stated.
- **Bot Logs**: Basic logs (such as errors or command usage) may be stored temporarily to improve performance and troubleshoot issues.

We do **not** collect or store any sensitive personal information, such as passwords, email addresses, or payment information.

## 2. How We Use Your Data

We use the data collected to:

- Provide, operate, and improve **Quincy**'s functionality.
- Ensure the security and stability of the Bot.
- Respond to commands and provide you with requested services.
- Analyze usage patterns to enhance the user experience.

Data collected is only used for the Bot’s intended purposes and will not be sold or shared with third parties, except as required by law.

## 3. Data Storage and Retention

We strive to keep data usage minimal and will retain collected data only for as long as necessary for the Bot’s functioning or to comply with legal obligations. Any temporary logs or message data that are not needed long-term are deleted regularly.

### Data Security

We take reasonable precautions to ensure that your data is stored securely. However, no method of data transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 4. Sharing Your Information

Your information will not be shared with third parties, except in the following cases:

- **Legal Requirements**: We may disclose your information if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.
- **Server Owners and Administrators**: Server data may be shared with server owners or administrators to assist in managing and improving their communities.

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your data to any other parties.

## 5. Your Data Rights

You have the right to:

- **Request Data Access**: You may ask what data has been collected related to your use of **Quincy**.
- **Request Data Deletion**: You may request the deletion of your data, subject to certain exceptions (such as data required by law or essential to the Bot's core functionality).

To exercise these rights, please contact us at Discord:**@artiriart**. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes to our data practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any changes will be posted on this page, and continued use of the Bot after changes signifies your acceptance of the updated policy.
